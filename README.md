# MentalLoad
### Delcombel Nicolas & Lylia Fauvel
## Aims
We aimed to mesure the mental load of an individual during a task.   
For this, EEG measurements were performed in five
individuals during a memory task. We have been interested in
the regularity of EEG signals. A low coeffient of regularity mean a high mental load.
## What I learned
* Theory of regularity measurement with methods such as DMA & DFA.
* Signal processing with Matlab
